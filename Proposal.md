# A4 Project Proposal Team 1
#### Abbey Kratman, April Bollinger, Arayah Remillard, Jonathan Asher, Gibson Phillips

The overall goal is to create a website to service the needs of a campus Amature Radio Club. There exists a website for the current radio club at WPI (radio.wpi.edu), but it doesnâ€™t meet the technical needs of the current student body. This project aims to outline a proof of concept of what the radio website could be. 
	For our techstack we will be tentatively using Typescript, however we may switch back to Javascript. We will be using Express.js for our server-side coding, and MongoDB for our backend. For our front end we will be using HTML and CSS.
	There will be static elements of the web pages, as well as dynamic elements pulling from a calendar, receiving an internet stream, and submitting forms. There will also be several authentication layers for radio hosts to manage their show as well as listeners to follow radio hosts.
