# A4 Project Proposal Team 1
#### Abbey Kratman, April Bollinger, Arayah Remillard, Jonathan Asher, Gibson Phillips

The overall goal of this project is to create a dynamic website to service the needs of WPI's on-campus Amateur Radio Club. 

There exists a website for the current WPI radio club (radio.wpi.edu), but it fails to meet the technical needs of the  student body. This project aims to outline a proof of concept towards what the radio website could be. 

For our techstack, we tentatively hope to use Typescript; however, we may switch back to Javascript depending on further research as we get into the weeds of the project. We will be using Express.js for our server-side coding, and MongoDB for our backend. For our frontend, we will be using HTML and CSS as demonstrated in previous assignments.

There will be static elements of the web pages, as well as dynamic elements pulling from a calendar, receiving an internet stream, and submitting forms. There will also be several authentication layers for radio hosts to manage their shows, as well as allowing listeners to follow radio hosts. 

We look forward to receiving your feedback on this proposal. Thank you!
