**Plan:**
Our plan is to create a music interest forum that allows users to create posts about specific songs or (user created) playlists. In addition, users would be allowed to interact with each other though commenting on each other's posts. Users will be able to create their own songs and playlists, and will also have access to a global database of all songs entered by users. Users will also be able to search for posts by title and for users by username. This allows for easy access to posts and user profiles. User profiles will store all the posts that user has made, their favorite songs, and their playlists. Users will be required to use a GitHub account for account creation and login.

We plan to stick with HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Node.js, and JavaScript, as we are very familiar with how to use these platforms. We plan to have one team focus primarily on front-end coding, and another team will focus primarily on back-end coding. We also plan to use Tailwind to help style the pages & Passport.js to allow for Oauth authentication through Github.
