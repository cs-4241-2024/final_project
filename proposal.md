Our team consists of Gabe, Kenneth, Sam, Najum, and me.

Our proposal idea is a job application traker. Our goal is to help students track each application they send out during the application season. The use case it's meeting is so students can have a central hub to see if they have upcoming interviews,
how may companies they have applied to, if they are expecting a response, etc. For workflow, they see the landing page, they log in via github oauth, and then they see the home page that shows their current applications and status.

For technologies, front end will be react js, html, css. Back end and scripting languages will be express.js. Database will be Mongodb. We will be use the Mern Stack essentially.
