Outline:

For our final project, we would like to create a website that allows users to go in, react/rate different video games, and share these reactions with friends. There are other popular websites out there that have this information for movies (letterboxd) and books (goodreads), but nothing for gamers to express their love for their favorite games! 
Our site will allow users to login, then see a page of different games. The user will then be able to click on a game, post a rating (-/5) and a review. The user will be able to see other people who posted underneath a given game as well. Games will also include game tags which will the allow the user to sort through game genres. 


Key Technologies:
    - React
    - MongoDB
    - Tailwind CSS
    - Mongoose
    - oidc (Oauth)
