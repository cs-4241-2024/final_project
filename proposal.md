# Project Proposal

**Due Date**: Sunday, September 22nd, 11:59 PM

## Project Overview

The website's goal is to operate as a Game Wishlist. The idea is for users to store a game and its price, applying a discount if need be, to determine if a game is worth buying at that time or not. Users can keep their data on the server and update it with recent discounts as well by logging or creating an account if they don't already have one. Additionally, users will be able to search for others' accounts to view their wishlists.

## Key Features

- **Feature 1**: Users can store game prices and set discounts to make better decisions
  regarding game purchases.
- **Feature 2**: Each user will have access to their own personal list of desired games.
- **Feature 3**: Users can view the wishlists of other users.

These features will serve as the primary focus areas for development and will guide the design and functionality of the project.

## Technologies and Libraries

We plan to use the following key technologies and libraries to implement our project:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Programming Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML/CSS

These tools will help ensure smooth development and high performance for our application.

## Conclusion

Meeting the expected project scope by the end of the term is certainly feasible, as a good portion of the server development has been finished already. The main challenges would be correctly setting up MongoDB to accommodate a web application with multiple users, and coordinating across different functionalities, but we believe that we can get this done.
