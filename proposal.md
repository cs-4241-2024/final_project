## Team 2 final project proposal: Wellness Tracker


Team names : Vivek Jagadeesh, Jeffrey Li, Carter Moore


## General Description:
Our application will be a "wellness tracker" which allows users to keep track of their wellness routine. Specifically, our application will allow users to keep track of their habits (water intake, etc.), utilize a dynamic reflection journal, build a support network, track their goals, and view the average mood across all users of the app.


## Technology Stack
Our application will be written using TypeScript. We made this choice because TypeScript enforces type-saftey across the app, which reduces the number of errors which occur during development. For our front end framework, we are going to use react.js. We made this choice because each of us have used react, and because re-usable components will allow us to take advantage of code re-use. Moving on, we will use TailwindCSS for our CSS framework. TailwindCSS makes it easy to create a consistent UI, and each of us is already familiar with it. Additionally, we will use Figma to create the design mock up for this app, which will allow us to diagram the UI before actually building it. As for our database, we are going to use CouchDB. We chose this over a relational database since our data does not have any natural relationships. Furthermore, we chose to use CouchDB instead of MongoDB because we wanted to try a new database management system. For our server framework, we are going to use Express.js due to our familiarity with the framework and its vast capabilities. For user authentication, we are going to use Auth0  due to its integration with react and express. Finally, our app will be deployed using vercel. We chose vercel because it is easy to create a CI/CD pipeline which deploys the app every time someone pushes to the main branch of the repo.
