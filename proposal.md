#### Project Title
- Cocktail Combo

#### Proposal
Our project, Cocktail Combo, will provide users with an easy way to discover new cocktail recipes based on ingredients they have available. The application allows users to select ingredients from a predefined list, and using those selections, generates cocktail suggestions. If users are logged in, they can save their creations and access the community feed where users can comment and rate different cocktail combinations. The app will be an interactive, community-driven cocktail recipe app with an intuitive and visually appealing interface. 

We plan to use MongoDB as our database to store user profiles, saved cocktail recipes, and community interactions. The frontend will be built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with a focus on responsiveness and ease of use. For user authentication, we are planning to use passport.js (google authentication) and/or a simple username and password input. This will allow users to securely log in and access personalized features. The application will use a cocktail api database (https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), The application will be created through Github for better collaboration and hosted on Glitch for easy deployment. The app will feature an elegant design, using custom styles in CSS to enhance the user experience.
