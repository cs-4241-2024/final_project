## Task Organizer - Final Project Proposal

  This project is a Task Organizer application. The key features will be task creation and management. Users can create a task by providing a task name, due date and a priority. They can also track the time they spend on that task. 
  
  The organizer enables users to schedule meetings. They can send invitations to other users who then can RSVP to indicate their participation. A calendar feature shows upcoming commitments. Users create an account to manage their tasks and meetings. Cookies and sessions help to maintain the userâ€™s login state. 
Users will be able to navigate through the site through a dedicated navigation bar.
  
  The technologies we will be using for this project are Node.js (server), Mongodb (database), HTML and CSS for the front end, and Javascript for the backend.
