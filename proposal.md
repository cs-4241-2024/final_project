# Final Project Proposal
By Eleanor Foley, Laura Pellowski, Ashley Jacob, Sophia John, Kayla Lem

## Outline
Sometimes people can struggle with achieving their goals and sticking to good habits. For our project, we decided to create a habit tracker, which is intended to be used to help motivate people with determining goals and sticking to routines of their choice.

Each user has their own login credentials, habits, goals, and points associated with their account. It will display their progress as well their consistency with said goals.

To aid with goal-achievement and routine-building, we intend to implement an AI chatbot, which will suggest to the user appropriate goals and routines based upon the userâ€™s input. The webpage will also feature a point-tracking system, which will reward users for consistently sticking to their goals. The user will take care of a pet, which will grow as the user gains more points and unlocks achievements. Moreover, we will implement a leaderboard for users to compare to other users.
	
The tools we will use for our project include Node.js for server-side, HTML/CSS/JS for the front end, and MySQL Workbench for the database. For the AI chat box implementation we plan to use openAI.
