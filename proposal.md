# Final Project
*Due October 10th by 11:59 AM*

For your final project, you'll implement a web application that exhibits understanding of the course materials. 
This project should provide an opportunity to both be creative and to pursue individual research and learning goals.

## General description
For our project, we plan to create an accessible web application designed to manage tournaments efficiently. This tournament management web application will provide users with a user-friendly interface to store, organize, and track data. 

## User Registration (sign up): 
Administrators, host of entire tourneys, will be able to make, alter, and post matches 
- Ability to alter/change data post-match (crucial for mistakes)
- -  Players mistype match points
- Make final decisions for match winners
- Keep score
- Coaches, captain of individual teams, will be able to add data for their individual members of their teams
- - Can add their roster at the start of the tournament
- - Dictates which players/teams they will send to play in the initial rounds 
- - Dictate which players are in what teams (Singles 1, Doubles 3 etc.)

## Round Robin:
- Schools/teams will be sorted into either Pool A or Pool B by administrators
- Teams will play through 5 rounds or round robin
- Teams will have a cumulative amount of points based on how many schools they won against
- - If teams are tied for points its determined by the point differential who is number one seed (for bracket)
    
## Elimination Bracket Tournament Creation
- Based on Round Robin results on their cumulative points teams will get seeded automatically
- The #1 teams in each pool get a bye (don't have to play in first round [preliminaries] of elimination bracket)

## Accessibility Features
- Toast notification (Delighter)
- - Pop-up feature that displays quick, non-intrusive messages on updates for recent tournaments played or results
- Filter feature 
- - Allow users to sort and search through match data by date, name, and school 
- Pop up notifications (Delighter)
- Alert users to important events or upcoming matches based on time sensitivity function

## Technologies/Libraries: 
- Next.js 
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind.css
- MongoDB
- Express
- Node.js


Provide an outline of your project direction and the names of associated team members. 
The outline should have enough detail so that staff can determine if it meets the minimum expectations, or if it goes too far to be reasonable by the deadline. Please include a general description of a project, and list of key technologies/libraries you plan on using (e.g. React, Three.js, Svelte, TypeScript etc.). Two to four paragraphs should provide enough level of detail. Name the file proposal.md and submit a pull request by Friday, September 20th at 11:59 PM (end of day). *Only one pull request is required per team*.

You will be given some class time to work on your proposal, but please plan on reserving additional time outside of class as needed. There are no other scheduled checkpoints for your project besides the final submission.
