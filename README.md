Project Members: Jagger Polvino, Owen rago, Nick Rogerson

For our project, we want to create a tetris clone. The end goal of our project is that we have a working score system and leaderboard where people can log in and keep track of their highscores via the leaderboard and hopefully compare scores with friends. The tetris gameplay will match that of traditional tetris and the website will consist of a login screen where players enter the same name that will be tracked on the leaderboard, and the game itself. Additionally, to satisfy the static element portion, we will have a tutorial that will show players how to play the game.

For the technologies that we plan to use, we think that we will use TypeScript to try something new. Additionally, we will employ Node.js and Express.js for our project. For our database, we will use MongoDB as we are more familiar with it through exprience with project 3.

What have we created is a fully functional Tetris game that matches that of traditional Tetris but we did not include a ramping fall speed for the blocks. As a sort of different take compared to other Tetris websites where you can play another player locally in a 1v1, we decided to add a leaderboard function where you compete against another players who have posted a score onto the leaderboard.

To start the database: npx tsx server.ts in terminal. Otherwise, there are no additional tools needed to access the website as there is a registration feature integrated in the website.

The technologies that we ended up using stayed consistent to what we planned to do. We continued to use React with TypeScript and Node.js for our website, successfully integrating Vite for fast builds and MongoDB as our database system, which streamlined development.

The challanges that we faced were, connecting to the database in a way that allowed us to both use a login and registration that also tracked users through the leaderboard, compliling into TypeScript also proved to be a challange as it took a while to get used to dealing with the errors that this presented.

The roles for each member were:
-Jagger Polvino: Front-end
-Nick Rogerson: Back-end
-Owen Rago: Game development and some front-end
