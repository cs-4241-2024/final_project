# Final Project
*Due October 10th by 11:59 AM*


## General description
Web application cataloguing video games. Includes a wishlist, account storage and login with Auth0, and game reviewing functionalities.
-**Frontend**: HTML/CSS
-**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, JavaScript
Some challenges that we faced were integrating programs that used React.js and Express.js. In the end, we decided to rewrite the entirety of the project in Express.js for consistency's sake. We also needed to collaborate in order to toggle MongoDB and set it up correctly.

## Contributions:

- Justin: Created the initial implementation of the game wishlist webpage and integrated the Auth0 login feature. 
          Added initial CSS styling in Login and Wishlist pages.
- Thomas: XX
