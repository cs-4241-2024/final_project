## General description
Web application cataloguing video games. Includes a wishlist, account storage, and game reviewing functionalities.
-**Frontend**: HTML/CSS
-**Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, TypeScript, JavaScript
Some challenges that we faced were integrating programs that used React.js and Express.js. In the end, we decided to rewrite the entirety of the project in Express.js for consistency's sake. We also needed to collaborate in order to toggle MongoDB and set it up correctly.
