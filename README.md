2. Addition instructions:
User need to sign up an account for the builder and liked list features. For the builder features, Don't drag the cards on the board, if you want to replace them you can just overwrite them with a new card from the left deck. That always leads to a situation where we can't fix it and need to empty the database to keep the app running while we continue to develop it. 
3. Outline of Technologies Used 
    -Frontend: We used React for our frontend and mui for our styling.
    -Backend: We used MongoDB for our database to collect the user login info and their team build and have public list and private list for showing different date whether login or not. We used Node.js for our server
    -Other: We used OnRender for running our development server.
4. Challenges Faced
   The positioning of the board and the cards, and the unfixable error mentioned in part2 of dragging and dropping the cards on the board again, as well as the fact that the two-person team didn't have enough time to complete a lot of the features that were envisioned, and the problems encountered with using google oAuth 2.0 that are still being worked on.
5. Responsible
   Because we only have two people, since there were only two of us, we didn't have a clear division of work and we both did full-stack work.
